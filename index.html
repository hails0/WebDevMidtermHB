                <h3> Hi! Iâ€™m Pancake</h3>
                <p>I have almost 5 years of experience of being a guinea pig, but 0 years of experience web developing. 
                    However, I am very confident that I can do a very good job at creating a website as long as my mom 
                    can do all the work for me. As a guinea pig, I am an avid and professional eater of lettuce, producer 
                    of intricate hay nests and hideouts, and the loudest wheeker in Pullman, WA. My wheeks are so loud, 
                    I scare my mom at 3 a.m. in the morning. That should tell you, I'm good at what I do as a guinea pig. 
                    I may not know what to do if you needed a full stack website, but I know I'm the best guinea pig.

            if(num2 == 0) {
                evenCountdown(num)
            }
            else {
                console.log("This is an odd number");
            }

            function evenCountdown(eNum) {
                for(let i = 1; i <= eNum; i++) {
                    console.log(i);
                }
